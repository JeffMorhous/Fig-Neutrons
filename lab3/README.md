# Static Web Site Redesign
The code for the teaching page was modeled off of 'https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp' without the responsive elements and modifying it for our needs.

## Building the site
To run, first execute 
``` 
bundle install (may need sudo)
```
then change directory to bond_site
```
cd bond_site
```

then run
```
middleman server
```
