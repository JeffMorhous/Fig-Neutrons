      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <p>Pick three cards to make a set. Click on a card to mark it as part of a set. 
      Click on a card again to unselect it. Cards are different in four ways:
      color, shape, number of shapes, and how the shapes are filled.
      To make a set, the details on the three cards must each be either
      all the same or all different. If you guess correctly, you get 3 points.
      If you guess incorrectly you lose a point. If you request a hint, you will
      lose 1 or 2 points depending on the hint type. There is no penalty if you 
      need to shuffle the board to get a new perspective. Have fun!</p>
