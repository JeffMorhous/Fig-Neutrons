      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <p>Pick three cards to make a set. Click on a card to mark it as part of a set. 
        Click on a card again to unselect it. Cards are different in four ways:
        color, shape, number of shapes, and how the shapes are filled.
        To make a set, the details on the three cards must each be either
        all the same or all different. If you guess correctly, you get 3 points.
        If you guess incorrectly you lose a point. If you request a hint, you will
        lose 1 or 2 points depending on the hint type. There is no penalty if you 
        need to shuffle the board to get a new perspective. You will be playing against 
        a timer. The length of the timer is dependent on the difficulty with easy having 
        infinite time, medium having 30 seconds and hard having 15 seconds to pick three 
        cards. If the player runs out of time they will lose a point. The timer resets 
        after the player selects three cards or the time runs out. If playing multiplayer 
        a players turn is ended after they either select three cards for a possible set 
        or after their time runs out. Click on New Game to begin. Have fun!</p>
