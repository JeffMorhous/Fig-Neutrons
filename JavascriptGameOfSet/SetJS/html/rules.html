    <h1>How To Play The Game Of Set</h1>
    <h3>Set (stylized as SET) is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974
      and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that
      vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number
      of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), shading (solid, striped,
      or open), and color (red, green, or purple).[1] Each possible combination of features
      (e.g. a card with [three] [striped] [green] [diamonds]) appears as a card precisely
      once in the deck.</h3>

    <h3>In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a set. For each one
      of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards
      must display that feature as <em>a) either all the same, or b) all different.</em> Put another way:
      For each feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the
      feature and the remaining card showing a different version.</h3>
