# The Game of Set Redesigned
This is a new version of the game of the set from the first lab, except done in JavaScript.
To play this game, enter the file path to where `index.html` is in the browser and follow the rules from there.

## Style Guide:
Our team used Javascript (semi)Standard Style, available at https://github.com/standard/standard
Semistandard conforms to Standard Style, but favors semicolons. This decision was made to be consistent
with the empahsis on semicolons Scott Sharkey presented in lecture.
